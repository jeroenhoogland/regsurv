Description: Provides functions to develop regularized flexible hazard and cumulative hazard models
    on right-censored survival data. Implemented regularization options include lasso, ridge, 
    elastic net and groups lasso penalties, which may be combined within a single model. Flexible 
    refers to spline-based baseline hazard or cumulative baseline hazard specification. The default
    is to model proportional covariate effects, but the regsurv package allows for easy incorporation 
    of time varying effects.
